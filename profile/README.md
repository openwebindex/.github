## The open source index of the web

The Open Web Index is an open source index of the web, gathered with open source software to power independent projects and searches.

We want to create indexes of the web, that are available for free, for everyone. We want to be as transparent as possible about how we gather data for our indexes. We want to power an independent web.

There are many open web indexes out there, and we're here too, to experiment and to expand the current independent data.

Let's make the web a bit better ✨
